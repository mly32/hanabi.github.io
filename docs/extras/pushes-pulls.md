### The Trash Push Prompt & The Trash Push Finesse

- If a player performs a *Trash Push* on a *one-away-from-playable* card, it is a signal that someone else has the connecting card as a *Prompt* or a *Finesse*.

<br />

### The Trash Pull

- Sometimes, towards the end of the game, there can be a playable card in the middle of someone's hand that is not cluable directly due to the presence of other blocking cards.
- In this situation, players often resort to a *Trash Push* in order to "get" the card without cluing it directly. However, this will only work if the player has a trash card on their chop, which may not always be the case.
- Another tool to "get" a card in the middle of a hand is by doing the opposite of a *Trash Push* - a *Trash Pull*.
- If an off chop trash card is clued, this would typically be interpreted as a *Trash Chop Move*. However, towards the end of the game, a *Chop Move* would be pointless, as there are no cards left to *Chop Move*. Thus, the player should know that it is a *Trash Pull* instead of a *Trash Chop Move*, and should blind-play the card to the right of the trash.
- Just like how a *5 Pull* can only be done in the *Early Game*, a *Trash Pull* can only be done towards the end of the game.
- Since players often perform *Burn* clues for stalling purposes in the *End-Game*, care has to be taken to not confuse a normal *Burn* clue with a *Trash Pull*. This is especially true if there was nothing else obvious for the clue giver to do!
- *Trash Pulls* should typically be used as a last-resort since they might be misinterpreted.

<br />

#### Interaction with Trash Double Ignition

- *Trash Pulls* and *Trash Double Ignition* are initiated in nearly the exact same way, so this can be confusing.
- *Trash Pulls* take precedence over *Trash Double Ignition*. This means that if everyone can see that the *Trash Pull* was necessary to "get" a blocking card, then no-one else on the team is promised to have a playable card. (This follows from *[Occam's Razor](../level-10.md#clue-interpretation--occams-razor)*.)
