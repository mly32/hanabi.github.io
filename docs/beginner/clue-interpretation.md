In conclusion, there are:

<!-- lint disable list-item-content-indent -->

1. *Play Clues*
    - normal *Play Clues*
    - *Delayed Play Clues*
1. *Save Clues*
    - the *5 Save*
    - the *2 Save*
    - the *Critical Save*

<!-- lint enable list-item-content-indent -->

And only one card is focused by a clue.

## Clue Interpretation Algorithm

When a clue happens and you need to figure out what it means, **always ask yourself the following questions**:

<!-- lint disable list-item-content-indent -->

1. What slot is focused?
    - Use the 3-step process we covered in the previous section.
1. Is it a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue* or could it be both?
    - Non-chop clues are always *Play Clues*.
    - Chop clues can be either a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*.
1. What is the identity of the card?
    - Based on whether it is a *Play Clue* or *Save Clue*, record all of the possibilities on the card as a note.
    - (On Hanab.live, you can right-click on cards to add notes to them.)

<!-- lint enable list-item-content-indent -->

Follow this algorithm every time! Don't skip a step!
