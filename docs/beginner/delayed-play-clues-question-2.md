- Previously, Cathy was clued about some 1's, and will go on to play both of them.
- Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which touches one card on slot 1. (This is a *Play Clue*.)
- Bob marks down the identity of the card.

1. What identity does Bob write down? (Be specific.)
2. Is this a *Delayed Play Clue*?
3. What action should Bob perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

1. Bob writes down an identity of blue 3 or purple 3.
2. No, this is not a *Delayed Play Clue*. Bob's 3 cannot connect to Cathy's red 1 or green 1 because no-one else has any connecting 2's.
3. Bob should probably play the 3 immediately (unless he has a good clue to give).
