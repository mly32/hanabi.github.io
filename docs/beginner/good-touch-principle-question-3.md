- Alice has a clued 2 in her hand of an unknown color. (It was *2 Saved* earlier on in the game.)
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- Alice could clue yellow to Bob or clue number 2 to Bob. Either clue would be a *Play Clue* on the yellow 2.
- However, it is possible that Alice's 2 is a yellow 2. If it was, then Alice would be violating *Good Touch Principle* and wasting a clue.
- Thus, it is not Alice's responsibility to clue the yellow 2. Someone else on the team will take care of that. Alice should discard, since there are no other clues to give.
