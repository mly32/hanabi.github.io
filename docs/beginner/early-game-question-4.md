- It is currently the *Early Game*. There is 1 clue token left.
- What action should Alice perform?

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="solution">

- The **only** legal action that Alice can perform is to clue number 5 to Donald as a *5 Stall* on the purple 5.
  - There are no playable cards and no savable cards. But since it is the *Early Game*, Alice must perform a *5 Stall* if it is available.
